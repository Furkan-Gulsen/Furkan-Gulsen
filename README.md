I'm Furkan Gulsen, a graduate of Software Engineering from Beykent University. I spent three years of my career at a Start-Up company called Ollang, working as a FullStack developer, specializing in BackEnd, FrontEnd and Artificial Intelligence. For the past two years, I have been focusing on my career as a BackEnd Developer in ikas. Additionally, although I'm not a professional in the field, I have been interested in Artificial Intelligence for about four years and I strive to share my knowledge through open-source projects. Considering myself as a content creator in the software field, I try to share articles on platforms like Medium, Dev , and my personal blog to share what I know and help others in the community.
